# SmartGreenhouse

SmartGreenHouse is an intelligent solution designed for greenhouse management, leveraging IoT technology to automate all essential processes required for maintaining the optimal environment.

This is achieved by using sensors and actuators. The application can automatically manage:
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Soil PH
* Soil Moisture
* Lights

Data from the sensors are collected and then stored in a MySQL database.
